• Awarded 2nd Place at UT Qiskit Fall Fest Quantum Computing Hackathon and advanced to IBM Qiskit Global Invitational Hackathon
<br>
• Investigated efficient algorithms for identifying and correcting errors caused by noise in quantum circuits using twirling and ML
<br>
• Generated a dataset of 825 Pauli Transfer Matrices to train a non-linear neural network with a fidelity loss function by iterating through 25 levels of amplitude damping and dephasing for 33 randomized circuits and performing quantum process tomography 
<br>
• Simulated amplitude damping with a controlled-Ry gate targeting the environment followed by a controlled-NOT gate targeting the qubit and simulated dephasing with a Ry gate on the environment followed by a CZ gate on the pair
<br>
• Tech: Python, Qiskit, PyTorch, SymPy, NumPy, Matplotlib, pandas, scikit-learn
